<p align="center">monorepository for `@wraft` Open Source packages</p>

## Technical decisions

The project is structured as a monorepository using [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/).
The code base is written in TypeScript and compiled to different JS formats (cjs, esm...) with [microbundle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/microbundle).

The "packages" subfolder contains published packages or shareable configurations
The "examples" subfolder contains illustrations

This setup is intended to support the following scenarios:

### TypeScript

> As a developer using TypeScript, can I benefit from type definitions from this library?

Yes: the project is written in TypeScript and types are statically exported at build time.

> As a developer using JavaScript, can I still use those packages?

Yes: the project is compiled to several formats (cjs, esm etc.) thanks to microbundle.
Just import what you need :)

### Tree-shaking

> I only need one component from the UI library, am I going to bundle the entire project if I import it?

Not necessarily: those packages are fully tree-shakeable and side-effects free.
As long as you **use a bundler supporting tree-shaking** (such as webpack, rollup etc.), you will get only what you need.

### Frameworks

> Are those packages only meant for React?

No: some packages of this project may have dependencies on React or other specific frameworks, but not all of them.
Refer to README.md file of each package if you want to know which dependencies they have.
